        <p id="hisp">The School: Mahadevi Birla Shishu Vihar, the first school of the Ashok Hall Group, started its journey as a fledgeling, a play school for Shri Aditya Vikram Birla in 1946. Since the time of its inception, our founder Late Sarala Birlaâ€™s astute faith in child-centric education has helped the school evolve into an institute par excellence.

            Our school achieved its first significant milestone in 1984 when it was accredited by the Indian Council of Secondary Education (ICSE). With the introduction of ISC for the higher secondary level, offering courses in all the three streams of Science, Commerce and Humanities, the school reached yet another turning point. Mahadevi Birla Shishu Vihar also became the first school in Kolkata to be certified by the International Organisation for Standardisation and can boast compliance with ISO 9001:2008 and ISO 14001:2015.

            Today, the school offers education of global dimensions, from pre-nursery to the high school level, nurturing about 2000 students. Dedicated faculty members, administrative staff and cooperative parents form a unified team making endeavours to transform every young mind into a progressive and productive citizen of the world.</p>
